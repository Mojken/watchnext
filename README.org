#+TITLE: Watchnext

* Watchnext
A thin wrapper around vlc for keeping track of series. Give it a directory with series and it will discover them, track how many episodes you've seen, and let you watch the next one.
Designed to be used with KDEConnect as a remote, but other mpris-controllers work just as well.
It does not currently listen to any other input however.
* Useage
Running =watchnext.py= for the first time will prompt you for a directory to scan and create the file =~/.config/watchnext/config=.
* License
=watchnext= is released under the AGPLv3, see =LICENSE=.
